-- Auto Loot, as a RollFor extension.
--
-- Master-loots the items the player has ticked -- and, under General, whole qualities -- the
-- moment a corpse opens, before anything else in the pipeline decides an item is still there.
-- The rule for what gets swept lives in src/AutoLoot.lua; this file is the integration surface.
--
-- It needs four things from core that a decorator-only extension does not: an award policy
-- (ctx.award_policy), a say in what gets announced as a drop (ctx.on_dropped_item), four
-- settings (ctx.config.register_toggle), and the selection tree and the window that draws it
-- (ctx.selection_tree / ctx.selection_tree_frame). The last pair arrived with API version 5.
--
-- API 6 is the one that matters here: core performs the award now, so this addon decides and
-- stops. `RollForAutoLoot.claims` is gone with it -- ctx.loot_claim( slot ) answers the same
-- question about the slot that was actually taken, which is the question it was standing in
-- for. That is a deliberate break, and the one a third party could notice.
--
-- The registration below runs at file scope: the TOC declares `## Dependencies: RollFor`,
-- which makes the client load RollFor first and refuse to load this addon without it.

  --
  -- Which is also where "auto-loot beats round robin" went. It used to be written down in the
  -- rotation, as a call into this addon's `claims`; it is a list the user can reorder now, and
  -- neither addon names the other.
