-- the widget set -- so a page can be assembled out of the same pieces RollFor's own page uses
-- rather than out of raw CreateFrame calls.

-- they are actually visible.

-- What this addon is for, in its own words. Core does not hold a copy: it has no use for one,
-- since this page is the only thing that shows it.
