-- against the same six read methods. Who reserved what, how names get matched to the
-- roster, what the import window looks like and what /sr does are all in here. Core's job
-- is to ask; this addon's job is to answer.
--
-- What this addon does *not* know is what a base64 string is. A **provider** -- a separate
-- addon such as RollForSoftResIt or RollForRaidRes -- registers a `decode` here, and that
-- is the whole of what "which website did this come from" means.
--
-- The registration at the bottom runs at file scope: the TOC declares
-- `## Dependencies: RollFor`, which makes the client load RollFor first and refuse to load
-- this addon at all without it, so RollFor.Extensions is there.
