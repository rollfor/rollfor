-- Who gets an item automatically, and core doing the handing out.
--
-- Phases answer *when* a handler runs and deliberately cannot answer *who gets this item*:
-- two policies competing for one slot are both in the Award phase, and ranking them is
-- exactly what a phase is not allowed to do. So the phase runs this, and this runs the
-- policies in order.
--
-- Core performs the award. A policy says what it would like -- a player name, or nil for
-- "not mine" -- and core resolves the candidate index, calls GiveMasterLoot and writes the
-- claim down. That is the whole of the fix: GiveMasterLoot is asynchronous, so a slot a
-- policy has taken is still sitting in the corpse when the next one looks at it, and
-- everything downstream reads the same stale list. The ledger is the answer to "is this
-- still up for grabs", and it is written at the point of action rather than re-derived from
-- a predicate -- which is what used to make one policy claiming an item it then could not
-- take mean nobody got it at all.
--
-- Slot-keyed, not item-keyed: two of the same gem in one window are two awards to two
-- different people, and an item id would collapse them onto one.
--
-- Cleared when a loot window opens rather than when one closes. LOOT_CLOSED can fire without
-- LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED -- the master looter assigning an item and walking away does it -- so
-- clearing on open is the one of the two that is robust to the client skipping an event.

-- award, and the next policy then gets its turn.
---@field decide fun( slot: number, item: DroppedItem ): string?

-- moving a rotation on, telling core's award callback. Separate from decide because only one

-- The RollFor project's own policies, in the order they went out with, seeding the first run
-- and nothing else.
--
-- This is not POSITIONS returning. That list was load-bearing: a name nobody occupied meant the
-- handlers anchored to it fell out of the chain and items went to the wrong person, which is why
-- vacancies needed placeholders. This is a seed value -- a name nobody registered is ignored, no
-- placeholder and no gap, an empty list works fine, and nothing anchors to it. And these are
-- the project's own addons -- RollForAutoLoot ships in RollFor's zip, RollForAutoRobin in its
-- own from rollfor/auto-robin -- so it is core knowing its own family rather than core knowing
-- a stranger's feature.
--
-- The soft failure to be aware of: if RollForAutoLoot renames its policy, this silently stops
-- applying to it and it lands below the known names instead. That costs a first-run ordering,
-- not correctness, and the user can drag it back.
--
-- Seeding from registration order was the alternative, and it is addon load order, which with
-- every pipeline addon declaring only `## Dependencies: RollFor` is alphabetical by folder name.
-- RollForAutoLoot above RollForAutoRobin preserves today's behaviour purely because L sorts
-- before R, and an addon called RollForAardvarkLoot would outrank both with nothing to explain
-- why.
