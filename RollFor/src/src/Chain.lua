-- An ordered chain of decorators, built once at login.
--
-- RollFor's soft-res view is a stack of decorators wrapped around SoftRes, and the order
-- they're stacked in decides who is allowed to roll for what. That order used to be
-- spelled out as a run of local variables in main.lua, which meant an extension could
-- only join it by being edited into that run.
--
-- Here, core declares the backbone links under stable names and extensions anchor to
-- those names. Anchoring to a name that doesn't exist is an error at build time rather
-- than a silent append: a mis-ordered soft-res chain produces wrong loot decisions, and
-- nobody would trace one back to here.
--
-- Anchors are resolved at build time, not as each link arrives, so a link may anchor to
-- one that has not been added yet. It has to work that way: addons load alphabetically,
-- so RollForNetherVortex declares itself before RollForSoftResIt contributes the very
-- links it anchors to, and neither addon can do anything about the other's name.
--
-- An anchor that is still unresolvable once everything has been added takes that one
-- link out of the chain and says so. It does not throw: build() runs in the composition
-- root, outside the pcall that isolates one extension's mistakes from the rest, so
-- throwing would turn a third-party typo into a failed login for the whole addon. Core's
-- own mistakes -- a duplicate name, a factory returning nil, a tap nobody declared --
-- still throw, because those are bugs here rather than out there.
