-- An extension addon declares `## Dependencies: RollFor` in its TOC, which makes the
-- client load RollFor first and refuse to load the extension at all without it. So
-- registration happens at file scope, long before PLAYER_LOGIN, and by the time
-- create_components() runs the registry is already complete.
--
-- Registration is unconditional: a disabled extension still registers, because that is
-- what puts it in the options window with a checkbox to turn it back on.

-- Bumped when the context object or the chain contract changes in a way that would break
-- an extension built against the previous number.
--
-- 6: the loot pipeline runs on phases. A handler declares `phase` -- when it runs -- and
-- `after`/`before` demoted to ordering siblings inside one. An extension anchored to another
-- extension's handler name no longer has anything to anchor to, which is the point: a name
-- is who a handler is, and it stopped doubling as where in the schedule it sits.
--
-- Also 6: handing items out automatically is an award_policy rather than a loot handler that
-- calls GiveMasterLoot itself, and RollForAutoLoot.claims is gone with no replacement --
-- loot_claim answers the same question, about the slot that was actually taken.
