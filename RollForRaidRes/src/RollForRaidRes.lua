-- The raidres wire format, and nothing else.
--
-- This addon is a **data provider** for RollForSoftRes. That addon owns the soft-res list,
-- the import window, the name matching, /sr and the registration with core's SoftResSource;
-- what it does not own is any opinion about base64, so a provider supplies one `decode` and
-- is otherwise absent. See SR-DIFF.md §7.
--
-- It creates no frames, claims no slash commands, adds nothing to any chain, subscribes to
-- nothing, and never touches SoftResSource. That is exactly what lets it and
-- RollForSoftResIt be installed at the same time -- which they could not be before, when
-- each carried a whole copy of the soft-res addon and the alphabet decided which one won.
--
-- Two registrations, in two places:
--
--   * with `Extensions`, at file scope, so this shows up in RollFor's options window with
--     its own page and its own Enabled checkbox, and reports its version through
--     `X-RollFor-Extension` like any other extension;
--   * with `RollForSoftRes`, from `on_enable`, which is what puts "raidres.top" in the
--     import window's Provider dropdown.

-- Core's shared helpers. The TOC declares `## Dependencies: RollFor, RollForSoftRes` and
-- the client refuses to load this addon without both. RollFor is named as well as implied
-- by the library, so unticking it in the addon list disables this one directly.
local m = RollFor

-- Handed over from on_enable, not from file scope and not from on_ready.
--
-- Not file scope, because a **disabled** extension never gets on_enable, and that is
-- precisely what keeps a disabled provider out of the dropdown -- no extra bookkeeping, no
-- flag to keep in step with the checkbox.
--
-- Not on_ready either: the TOC chain loads RollForSoftRes first, so its on_ready runs
-- before this one, and it builds the window there. A decoder handed over from on_ready
-- would arrive after the window that needs it.
